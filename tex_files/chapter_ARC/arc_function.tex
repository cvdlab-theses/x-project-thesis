\section{Single Page Application: how it works}
\label{sec:ARC_function}

An approach to implementing the single page pattern on today's web that makes it easy to get it right. It's based on three principles.
\begin{itemize}
\item Every view must have a real URL. On a normal web page, at any time I can grab what's in my browser's URL bar and either share it or bookmark it.
\item Every link must be a real link. On a normal web page, I can view a link's destination by hovering it with my mouse; right-clicking produces a menu of link-specific options. So many otherwise-good pages try to implement their own link-like behavior by catching clicks on specific DOM nodes but then screw up corner case behaviors like middle-click.
\item It's ok to be less awesome on old browsers. (Of course, whether this is actually true depends on site's goals.) One tactic for old browsers is just to fail gracefully: if the site still works but is just slower, that's ok. For example, Gmail used to implement each of its buttons with a soup of DOM nodes to get the gradients and rounded corners to show on IE6; on today's web, maybe it's ok to just use some newer CSS for those effects and allow the buttons to be square and flat on IE6.
\end{itemize}

Because of principle 1,the  app must be capable of rendering any given view from scratch, because the URL load might be a freshly started browser that just loaded a bookmark. Because of principle 2, links must be implemented as plain old <a> tags with an href that points at the URL of the resulting view.

\subsection{Local Routing}

In this section has been presented the operation and the importence of local router to the manage of page request from the user.
When using the standard pattern requiring a new page is done using GET: the browser itself sends the page request to the server, which responds by sending the page or performing the desired action.
With the pattern SPA, the workflow is different, since, through the use of a router client side prevents the default behavior of the browser described above.
The implementation of this pattern involves the following steps: recording listening to change the path; at each event of this type, the request is handled by a mapping path / handler, in which each path is associated with a function. In general, these functions have the task of fetching the template and the content needed to fill the latter.

\subsection{Server architecture}

\textbf{Thin server architecture}

A SPA moves logic from the server to the client. This results in the role of the web server evolving into a pure data API or web service. This architectural shift has, in some circles, been coined ``Thin Server Architecture'' to highlight that complexity has been moved from the server to the client, with the argument that this ultimately reduces overall complexity of the system.

\textbf{Thick stateful server architecture}

The server keeps the necessary state in memory of the client state of the page. In this way, when any request hits the server (usually user actions), the server sends the appropriate HTML and/or JavaScript with the concrete changes to bring the client to the new desired state (usually adding/deleting/updating a part of the client DOM). At the same time, the state in server is updated. Most of the logic is executed on the server, and HTML is usually also rendered on the server. In some ways, the server simulates a web browser, receiving events and performing delta changes in server state which are automatically propagated to client.

This approach needs more server memory and server processing, but the advantage is a simplified development model because a) the application is usually fully coded in the server, and b) data and UI state in the server are shared in the same memory space with no need for custom client/server communication bridges.

\textbf{Thick stateless server architecture}

This is a variant of the stateful server approach. The client page sends data representing its current state to the server, usually through AJAX requests. Using this data, the server is able to reconstruct the client state of the part of the page which needs to be modified and can generate the necessary data or code (for instance, as JSON or JavaScript), which is returned to the client to bring it to a new state, usually modifying the page DOM tree according to the client action which motivated the request.

This approach requires that more data be sent to the server and may require more computational resources per request to partially or fully reconstruct the client page state in the server. At the same time, this approach is more easily scalable because there is no per-client page data kept in the server and, therefore, AJAX requests can be dispatched to different server nodes with no need for session data sharing or server affinity. \cite{arc_over}
