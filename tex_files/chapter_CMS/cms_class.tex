\section{CMS classification}
\label{sec:CMS_class}

The classic and most popular CMS (e.g. Joomla! and Wordpress) have nearly eliminated the role of the developer, by inserting graphics creation tools and providing presets, covering a large part of the most common requests. Other CMSs, that are emerging at this time, have made the developer even stronger, by heavily focusing on the possibility of personalization and customization of the product.

Since the beginning of the Internet, the ability to create and publish content on the web has marked the success of Content Management Systems. Products like Joomla! or WordPress, born to handle simple websites or blogs, have evolved to support web applications of any sort (from personal portfolio to on-line shopping), running as of January 2015 more than 25\% of the top ten million websites \cite{cms_stats}. This evolution has been allowed by a plug-in based architecture, where each plug-in is responsible to handle a functionality subset of the whole application, by presenting the user through a simple accessible configuration and management interface.
The large number of available plug-ins covers most of the common and frequently required customizations, thus avoiding to write ad-hoc code. Nevertheless, the implementation of specific functional characteristics inevitably requires requires a code-levl intervention.

In recent years, however a return to basics has occurres. New CMSs are giving importance to the developer's role. CMSs as KeystoneJS and Ghost.org make the customization a strength.
Therefore, they sacrifice the ease of use and the possibility of utilization even for non-experts, in favour of product customization.
Nowadays, two categories of CMSs can be distinguished:
\begin{itemize}
\item User oriented CMSs: mostly visual and presetted;
\item Developer oriented CMSs: customizable frameworks that need written code to be used by the admin.
\end{itemize}
