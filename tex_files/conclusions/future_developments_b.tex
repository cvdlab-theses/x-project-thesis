\section{Future developments}
\label{sec:conclusions_future_developments}

At this moment X-Project shows up as basic platform on top of which many applications can be implemented. Future developments are already the present. Nowadays X-Blog (see \ref{chapter_CAS}), X-Journal and X-Commerce are in different development stages. The goal of these project is to make products to categorize and fill specific needs. For example, X-Commerce is an application dedicated to transactions for the sale of goods and services. In parallel with the creation of new platforms, X-Elements (\ref{XPR_xel}) is constantly replenished with new elements.
In X-Commerce case these elements are implemented to manage credit cards, handle transactions and integrate payment gateways.

Moreover, X-Project needs to be more functional. The development of a service that allows to install the whole platform with a command can surely raise the functionality level: this feature will be implemented via Yeoman Generator\footnote{Yeoman is an open source client-side development stack, consisting of tools and frameworks intended to help developers quickly build high quality web applications.}.

User management component needs the implementation of elements that unite the various services offered by many social networks. The advantage of this service is to simplify any interaction between user and services, such as logging in and signing up via Facebook or Google account.
