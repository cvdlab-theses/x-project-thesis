Most of the work has been performed to lay X-Project groundwork. As seen in previous chapters, the work is based on the union of several technologies and services. This mix gives birth to an hybrid platform that lies between content management systems and web application frameworks.
The output is a functional and cutting edge product.

X-Blog, the use case analyzed, has been real useful to understand benefits and limits of this platform, and to realize where, this project, needs imrpovements.
As said before, client-side benefits are borrowed from Polymer and Web Components environment. Code reusability and access to reusable code are, clearly, one of the most important aspects of the project that lead to the implementation of a set of elements (X-Elements, see \ref{sec:XPR_xel}).
Moreover, the encapsulation and the isolation of various parts of a component (presentation, behaviour and content) lead to the creation of stand alone service elements (S3 component), behavioural elements(API elements) and mixins(style elements).
Server-side benefits are represented by the easy way of API creation: describing procedures and model definitions are direct and can generate API and behavioural elements as well. 

Finally, the union between server-side and client-side technologies allowed to create vertical elements that cross all the architectural stack.
