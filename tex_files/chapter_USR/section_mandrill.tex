\subsubsection{Mailchimp}
\label{subsubsec:USR_mandrill_mailchimp}
MailChimp is an email marketing service and trading name of its operator, a United States company, founded in 2001.
The MailChimp service is accessed through a web- or mobile-based application; for some features there is an offline application.
MailChimp began as a paid service and added a freemium option eight years later.[5] It was originally going to be called ChimpMail, but the name was changed after the company discovered that they could not get that domain name.
The company's logo is a chimpanzee, and the site includes numerous chimp-related graphics and humor on its website and in its communications.
