\section{X-Project Architecture}
\label{sec:XPR_arc}

A Web application developed using the x-project toolkit, an x-project app, is a full stack JavaScript Single Page Application.

Server Side

On the server side, an X-Project app is based on NodeJS (CIT 2.4) used to create the server environment, MongoDB (CIT 2.5) used to storage data, and the Web framework Loopback by Strongloop (CIT 2.6).
Loopback generates model API from the models schemas, to let CRUD operations on models. These schemas are JSON documents.

Client Side

On the client side, an X-Project app is based on HTML5 Web Components via Polymer-Project by Google.
On the top of this stack lies X-Elements a se of Polymer elements for local routing, API request, forms, lists, style and admin pages, as listed further (CIT 4.BOH).
