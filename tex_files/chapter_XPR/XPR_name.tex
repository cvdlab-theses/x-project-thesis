\section{Why the name?}
\label{sec:XPR_name}

The name X-Project has been chosen for three different reasons.
First of all, X character, in maths, can represent every value. Just as this project, the X is variable. X-Project can be used to make any kind of web application, from blogs to e-commerce websites.
So this versatility of mathematical X, fits this project soul.
Secondly, all experimental elements' name created by Google during the dawn of Polymer-Project were preceded by a ``X-'' prefix.
Finally, the X-Project is a sort of a tribute to X-Tag: the Mozilla's web components library \cite{xtag}.
