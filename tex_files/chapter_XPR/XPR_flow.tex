\section{Document-Driven Web Development Process}
\label{sec:XPR_flow}

The process to build a web application based on x-project toolkit consists of the following four steps: models schemas definition, HTTP RESTful API definition, UI components definition and UI components assembly.

\subsection{1st step - Models schemas definition}
\label{sec:XPR_flow_first}
A description of entities, properties, relations and data access policies are defined as JSON documents.

\subsection{2nd step - HTTP RESTful API definition}
\label{sec:XPR_flow_sec}
CRUD operations on models are automatically generated by the web framework (on the basis of input JSON documents) and further custom actions can be defined. All of them are exposed as HTTP RESTful API.

\subsection{3rd step - UI components definition}
\label{sec:XPR_flow_third}
Distinct UI components can be defined, or retrieved from a collection of predefined components, configured and adapted. They represent the building blocks of the whole UI.

\subsection{4th step - UI components assembly}
\label{sec:XPR_flow_third}
Distinct UI components are finally mounted to compose the application views. Assembly is kept as simple as possible: it only con- sists of a composition of HTML5 elements.
So the entire development process results driven by: JSON documents describing entities of the application and HTML template documents describing the UI components.
